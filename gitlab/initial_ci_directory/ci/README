It's BETA stage - limited knowledge is required or can be obtained on the FreeCAD forum.

The is the test bed to replace travis-CI that no longer is sufficient for FreeCAD CI (continuous integration)

The current (end of Jul 2021) plan is to use gitlab CI + enternal runners. External runners are nothing more than processes that build FreeCAD on external machines.

The system consists of 3 elements:
1. command and control: gitlab. Possibly can be replaced with FreeCAD own gitlab server if needed.
2. configuration files: .gitlab-ci.yml, Dockerfile and authentication token from gitlab CI settings
3. local machine executing the build

1. Currently the test aims for gitlab as the brain of the system due to convinience. All is required is a repo on gitlab (Yorik's repo is already set up). The gitlab CI can be controlled from the repo settings. If you want to help with tests please set up a fork of FreeCAD.

2. .gitlab-ci.yml tells gitlab CI how to build FreeCAD. This file contains key "image: freecadci/runner" that defines what image should be used to build FreeCAD.

3. Image freecadci/runner is defined in the Dockerfile. It contains all dependencies required to build FreeCAD, bash + text editors (vim, nano) to allow interactive debugging. The image after being locally build was pushed to dockerhub. It's stored here: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/freecadci/runner

3. Local machine - I currently test bare metal builds (fedora). There are some configuration caveats depending on the system (selinux), so please test and report errors on the FreeCAD forum in Developiers Corner: https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewforum.php?f=10

Scripts:
register-with-gitlab - registers external runner with gitlab. To run it should should obtain the CI token first. See "Test procedure" below.
run-container - runs container (created from docker image) that executes the builds

check-all - convinience script showing all images, volumes and containers. Not required. Use to check what images, volumes and containers are on local machine.

Test procedure:
1. Install docker on your local machine
2. Fork mine repo https://gitlab.com/PrzemoF/FreeCAD or ano other FreeCAD repo and copy content od ci directory
3  Switch to branch gitlab-v3
4. In gitlab->Settings->CI/CD->General pipelines->CI/CD configuration file set location to ci/.gitlab-ci.yml
3. Copy registration token from gitlab Settings->CI/CD->Runners->Registration
5. run "register-with-gitlab registration-token"
6. run "run-container"

The above setup should create and register docker container that is ready to accept builds from gitlab.
To test is got to CI/CD->editor in gitlab and click "commit changes"

FAQ:
1. How to stop the container?
	As we run container with "always restart" parameter, so to stop it it has to be changed to prevent container from beinr restarted:
	docker update --restart=no <container_id>

PLEASE REPORT ALL PROBLEMS/ERRORS on the FreeCAD forum.

Well done - your read it all! :-)
